# **AI Water Watch**  
*A Gemini CLI–Powered Sustainability Insights Dashboard*

> A proof-of-concept (POC) that uses **Google Gemini** (via the **Gemini CLI / Vertex AI**) and **Streamlit** to explore how **AI data-center expansion intersects with water stress** across U.S. states. Built during a Gemini CLI technical workshop.

---

## **Why this matters**
- AI data centers require **large volumes of fresh water** for cooling.
- **Water scarcity is regional** — some states face chronic shortages.
- **Policy and investment decisions are often made by non-technical leaders.**
- There is a growing need for **Tech Ambassadors** who translate system impacts responsibly.

**AI Water Watch** addresses this by:
- Turning raw data into **clear visualizations**
- Allowing users to **ask questions in natural language**
- Producing **executive-grade policy summaries**, not hype

---

## **What the POC Demonstrates**
| Capability | Description |
|---|---|
| Dashboard | State-level KPIs, stress comparisons, time trends, map visualization |
| Conversational Analytics | Ask “Show trend of water use per center” → get a chart instantly |
| Policy Advisory Mode | Executive Summary generated by Gemini |
| Data Pipeline | Synthetic dataset simulating monthly hydrology & infrastructure parameters |

---

## **Why the Gemini CLI Was Critical**
- Allowed **fast trial → refine → re-run** during development.
- Enabled **the same model across CLI + Python** without switching environments.
- Supports **governance-ready prompting** (short, clear, non-speculative outputs).
- Turned NL questions into **structured chart instructions** (JSON → Plotly).

> Very few AI ecosystems offer **a unified CLI + model runtime** that *feels like a data scientist’s toolchain*. Gemini CLI made this practical.

## **Run Locally**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py

## **Google Cloud Shell (recommended)**
pip install -r requirements.txt
gcloud services enable aiplatform.googleapis.com
streamlit run app.py --server.port 8080 --server.enableCORS false --server.enableXsrfProtection false

## **Limitations (POC Stage)**

* Uses synthetic hydrology and AI Center data.
* Stress metric is indicative, not a regulatory standard.
* NLQ model occasionally returns underspecified plots; fallback logic prevents failure.

## **Next Enhancements**

* Replace synthetic data with real basin-level hydrology datasets
* Add data-center cooling technology variants
* Host as public Streamlit Cloud / Cloud Run app
* Add unit tests for NLQ routing
